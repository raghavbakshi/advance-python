    "3. The use of circular importing— such as two modules importing each other— can create dependencies and hidden bugs. How might you design a program to avoid mutual importing?\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "Circular importing means importing the two modules in each other. If suppose we are wokring in MOD1.py file and it is importing some function say F2() from some other module say MOD2.PY file or we can do vice-versa. What will happen is: This will give an import error.\n",
