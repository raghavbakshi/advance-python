    "Ans.\n",
    "Histogram is a type of a plot which hold the total number of counts or the percentile value in y-axis w.r.t. corresponding x-variables. When we say the number of counts it means that for a particular range in x-axis what will be the number of counts of the data points. When we talk about percentile it shows the probability occurrence of the x-variable or what percentage of data are below that particular percetile value w.r.t. particular x-variable range.\n",
