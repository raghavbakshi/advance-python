    "1. What exactly is a probability distribution? How can you predict the values at all, if they are supposed to be random?\n",
    "Ans. Probablity distribution is the distribution of data in such a way that they are distrubuted based on the probability of occurence of different outcomes in the experiment. The predicted values are the probability occurrence of the outcomes. They can be find out by using some probability density function formulae. This will give the prabability of occurrence of the outcome.\n"

    "2) The sum of the probabilities is equal to 1\n",

For example, the probability of picking up an ace in a 52 deck of cards is 4/52; since there are 4 aces in the deck. The odds of picking up any other card is therefore 52/52 – 4/52 = 48/52\n",

    "5. How would you expect a probability distribution to behave in the short run? How would you expect it to change as the number of trials increases?\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "In short run lets take an example of a dice throws twice and we gather the probability of getting all the numbers from 1 to 6 in both the trials. We do the pairing and then we find the average and with these average we will find put the probability of occurrence of the mean number. If we plot this using histogram we find that it is normally distributed. This is refer to the probability distribution.\n",
    "As the number of trials increases, there will no impact on the shape of the curve because at any how the probability of occurrence of an event wil lie between 0 and 1. Moreover, the graph will be wider based on the interval range.\n"
