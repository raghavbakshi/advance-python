    "1. How would you describe the relationship of a class to its instances? For example, is it a one-to-one or a one-to-many relationship?\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "A instance of a class is refer to an object of a class through which we refer all the class class attributes , class methods and everything which comes inside the class.\n",
    "An instace of a class is an entity which refer to a class. It symbolize the class. So we can say that it one to many relationship kind of thing.\n",
    "For example, we have an iphone. It is an object as the person who made that phone has refer its name as Iphone thats why we call it an Iphone. BUt at the sam etime that Ipihone is beong to some smartphone class. So we can say that it is an instance of a smartphone class.\n",
    "Moreover instance and object are the same thing. Creatig an class object means creating an instance of a class, through which we refer to all those things which come under the class\n"

It is possible in python to inherit the behaviour and properties of some other class so as to avoid writing the same code again and again when it is required. We can even do the multiple inheritence.

    "Ans.\n",
    "Python supports encapsulation. It combine all the behaviour, properties and attributes of a class inside a single class object. So that we do not have to perform separate separate operation through different means. We just need a single object to perfomr all those task. It also hide the implementation of the task. Means we do ot required to focus on the backend task. We just need to foucs on the output, result when any operation si performed.\n",
    "If we talk about making instance or class variables private, then yes. It makes them both of them private so that there is not chances of changing or modifying the code or some values.

    "Ans.\n",
    "init method is basically used for constructing the object variables meaning, initialisation of object variables happen, where the class attributes gets the values from the class instance where the values are stored. So when we want to inherit the attributes/variables of the class then we need to inherit the init method also. This implies that whatever the variables were initialise in the parent class, those will also get initialise in the subclass. We uses super() method in order to call the parent class.\n",
    "We can customise the behaviour of the subclass by declaring some new other attributes and initialising them. However these new attributes will only get accessed by the subclass object. We could use overridding technique also for changing the behaviour of the init method without defining it separately inside the subclass\n",
