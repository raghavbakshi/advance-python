    "2. What are some situations in which the use of text files would be the best solution? In what situations might you want to use binary files instead?\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "Text file: When we wan to store some information in such a way that every one can easily understand. Means readable and understood by the human not to the machine then in that case we prefer using text file. We can store any kind of information by using just simply writing the characters. We do not write the information in the form of bits and all. So that if any thing is written wrong in that and cause some erro then it can be easily handle.\n",
    "Binary file: When we want to make some kind of a file which can only read by the machine not by the human then we use binary file. With this file we can store the information in bits. We can only be able to see the final functionality of the file like pdf file, audio file, video files, etc. We can only see the fina function but do not see the available data inside that which helped in maing that application.\n"

    "Ans.\n",
    "While reading,read method returns a sequence of bytes as a string. With using binary operaions i.e. using bitwise operator the integers are first converted into binary and then operations are performed on bit by bit. This is a very lengthy task from usual steps. More over it is not possible for a reader to read the integers in binary format.\n"
