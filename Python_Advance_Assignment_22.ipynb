    "•\tIn arrays, the elements can be accessed randomly by using the index number.\n",

    "Ans\n",
    "•\tThe number of elements to be stored in an array should be known in advance.\n",
    "•\tAn array is a static structure (which means the array is of fixed size). Once declared the size of the array cannot be modified. The memory which is allocated to it cannot be increased or decreased.\n",
    "•\tInsertion and deletion are quite difficult in an array as the elements are stored in consecutive memory locations and the shifting operation is costly.\n",

    "Ans.\n",

    "•\tAn array is a single dimensional entity which hold the numerical data, while numpy can have more than 1 dimension.\n",
